# Drinks Machine Program (GreenSlate Coding Challenge)

## Attn GreenSlate engineering team!

<p>
Thank you for giving me an opportunity to participate in this coding challenge.<br />
However, I have not implemented some assessment requirements due to a lack of time.<br />
I had part-time work to do.<br />
I would appreciate 1 or 2 extra days to complete an assessment.
